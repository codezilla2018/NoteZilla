### Oshan Mudannayake | [OshanIvantha](https://github.com/OshanIvantha) | University of Colombo School of Computing

Hi, I am your average geek reading for a CS major at UCSC. I am in my 3rd year now. I had some experience as a developer even before coming to the university. But I never got the chance to actively contribute to the open source projects until this year. I am participating in GSoC as a candidate in CERN-HSF. So CodeZilla would be my second open-source related experience. And I am really happy that I got this chance because I got to learn new things while contributing back to the community.
