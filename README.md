### [Chamath Sandaru Ranasinghe](https://github.com/rexzing) - University of Moratuwa 

Hello, I am a techie (Don't get this too seriously) who is following IT degree at University of Moratuwa. I have some experience in several projects with python, django and rxjs technologies. Although I wanted to contribute in a open source project since the beginning of the last year, I couldn't accomplish it until this hackathon. This is the first time I developed a library in JS so it took some time to get familier with best practices and tools, but it wasn't a waste of time. I really enjoyed working on this project and watching other projects and thier commits. Dear Codezilla organizers, thank you very much for give us this oppertunity to have a great experience.

Hi, I am your average geek reading for a CS major at UCSC. I am in my 3rd year now. I had some experience as a developer even before coming to the university. But I never got the chance to actively contribute to the open source projects until this year. I am participating in GSoC as a candidate in CERN-HSF. So CodeZilla would be my second open-source related experience. And I am really happy that I got this chance because I got to learn new things while contributing back to the community.
